> **The American Historical Association** is the largest membership association of professional historians in the world. The annual meeting, which in 2024 took place in San Francisco, was my first time at the AHA. I presented a poster about my research at the intersection of Ottoman history and computational linguistics. I created this page to share supplemantary information, including some translations. More information about this year's meeting, can be found in [this link.]([https://aha.confex.com/aha/2024/meetingapp.cgi/Home/0](https://aha.confex.com/aha/2024/meetingapp.cgi/Home/0)https://aha.confex.com/aha/2024/meetingapp.cgi/Home/0])
